# Deep Research Web UI

[English | [中文](README_zh.md)]

This is a web UI for https://github.com/dzhng/deep-research, with several improvements and fixes.

Features:

- 🚀 **Safe & Secure**: Everything (config, API requests, ...) stays in your browser locally
- 🕙 **Realtime feedback**: Stream AI responses and reflect on the UI in real-time
- 🌳 **Search visualization**: Shows the research process using a tree structure. Supports searching in different languages
- 📄 **Export as PDF**: Export the final research report as Markdown / PDF
- 🤖 **Supports more models**: Uses plain prompts instead of newer, less widely supported features like Structured Outputs. This ensures to work with more providers that haven't caught up with the latest OpenAI capabilities.
- 🐳 **Docker support**: Deploy in your environment in one-line command
- 🔧 **Server Mode**: Deploy with environment variables, no need for users to configure API keys

Currently available providers:

- AI: OpenAI compatible, SiliconFlow, Infiniai, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Ollama and more
- Web Search: Tavily (1000 free credits / month), Firecrawl (cloud / self-hosted)

### Self hosted

#### Server Mode (Recommended)
Deploy with environment variables - users don't need to configure API keys:

**Using Docker with environment variables:**

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e NUXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_MODE=true \
  -e NUXT_AI_API_KEY=your-ai-api-key \
  -e NUXT_WEB_SEARCH_API_KEY=your-search-api-key \
  -e NUXT_PUBLIC_AI_PROVIDER=openai-compatible \
  -e NUXT_PUBLIC_AI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini \
  -e NUXT_PUBLIC_WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER=tavily \
  anotia/deep-research-web:latest
```

**Using Docker with .env file:**

```bash
# Create .env file with your configuration
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env anotia/deep-research-web:latest
```

#### Client Mode (Traditional)
Users configure their own API keys in the browser:

One-click deploy with [EdgeOne Pages](https://edgeone.ai/products/pages):

[![Deploy with EdgeOne Pages](https://cdnstatic.tencentcs.com/edgeone/pages/deploy.svg)](https://edgeone.ai/pages/new?from=github&template=https://github.com/AnotiaWang/deep-research-web-ui&from=github)

Use pre-built Docker image:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 --name deep-research-web -d anotia/deep-research-web:latest
```

Use self-built Docker image:

```
git clone https://github.com/AnotiaWang/deep-research-web-ui
cd deep-research-web-ui
docker build -t deep-research-web .
docker run -p 3000:3000 --name deep-research-web -d deep-research-web
```
